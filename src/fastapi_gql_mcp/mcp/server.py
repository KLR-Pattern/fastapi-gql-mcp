class FastAPIMCP:
    """Expose a FastAPI app as an MCP server backed by a GraphQL schema.

    Args:
        app: The FastAPI application whose routes become the schema.
        name: MCP server name shown to clients.
        instructions: Usage guide agents receive with the ``initialize``
            handshake (MCP protocol field) — a short map of the domains and
            how to query. ``None`` (default) sends nothing.
        include/exclude: fnmatch globs over route paths (exclude wins).
        include_tags/exclude_tags: fnmatch globs over route tags
            (exclude_tags wins). A route matches when ANY of its string
            tags matches ANY pattern — "iam:*" matches tags=["iam:users"].
            Enum tags are ignored. include_tags is a strict whitelist:
            untagged routes are dropped; with only exclude_tags set,
            untagged routes stay. Tag filters AND with path filters (a
            route must pass both); dropping is silent, like path filters.
        allow_mutation: Expose POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE routes as GraphQL
            mutations. Default False (read-only).
        mutation_include: fnmatch globs limiting WHICH write routes become
            mutations (requires allow_mutation=True).
        passthrough_headers: Whitelist of inbound header names (case
            insensitive) MCP/GraphQL callers may forward into route calls.
            ``None`` (default) forwards ``authorization`` — each client acts
            as its own JWT user, the FastAPI security schemes doing the
            verifying. Session cookies ride the ``Cookie:`` request header,
            so cookie-authenticated apps add the literal name:
            ``passthrough_headers=["authorization", "cookie"]`` (wired
            example: examples/notes_oauth). Pass ``[]`` to disable
            forwarding entirely. With no HTTP request context (in-memory
            client) nothing is forwarded: protected routes answer 401.
            Protocol headers (``content-type`` / ``accept``) are refused
            even if whitelisted — the invoker owns them, and a forwarded
            value would retype the JSON request.
        request_timeout: Per-route-call timeout in seconds (default 30,
            ``None`` disables). Enforced with asyncio.wait_for — httpx's
            own timeout is inert on the in-process ASGI transport.
        max_concurrency: Bound on in-flight route calls across all queries
            (default 16, ``None`` disables). Sibling GraphQL fields resolve
            concurrently, so one wide query fans out; this protects the
            wrapped app's upstream from being hammered by its own bridge.
            Queueing for a slot counts against ``request_timeout``.
        max_depth: Maximum GraphQL selection-set nesting accepted per
            document (default 10, ``None`` disables). Recursive models make
            depth unbounded, and an MCP caller is an LLM that can emit
            runaway nesting — overly deep documents are rejected before
            execution with a validation-style error.
        document_cache_size: LRU capacity for the parse+validate front half
            of execution, keyed by the query string (default 128, 0
            disables). Agents repeat documents constantly; a hit skips
            straight to execution. Execution results are never cached —
            per-call credentials run for real every time.
        auth: Optional ``fastmcp`` auth provider (e.g.
            ``fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github.GitHubProvider``). Passed
            through to ``FastMCP`` untouched: the MCP endpoint then answers
            401 with OAuth discovery metadata, and clients' Bearer tokens
            reach the routes via ``passthrough_headers`` like any other
            caller's. The bridge itself verifies nothing. A bare
            ``fastmcp.server.auth.auth.TokenVerifier`` subclass (override
            ``verify_token``) gates the endpoint the same way, without the
            OAuth machinery.
        mode: ``simple`` registers get_schema + graphql_query;
            ``progressive`` registers the 4-layer tag-based disclosure
            (list_domains -> list_queries -> get_query_schema ->
            graphql_query); ``auto`` picks progressive once the schema
            carries more than ``progressive_threshold`` routes (counted
            after path and tag filtering).
        include_hidden: Also scan routes with ``include_in_schema=False``.
        exclude_deprecated: Drop routes declared ``deprecated=True`` — a
            config-level silent drop, like the path/tag filters. Routes
            that stay keep their GraphQL-native deprecation mark.
