"""Reject overly deep GraphQL documents before execution.

Recursive models (a Node whose children are Nodes) make query depth
unbounded: graphql-core happily executes a thousand nested selections, and
an MCP caller is an LLM that can emit such a document. The guard measures
selection-set nesting (the root selection set is depth 1) with fragments
resolved inline and cycles rejected — spreading a deep query across
fragments cannot hide it.

Introspection meta-fields (``__``-prefixed) do not count: standard tooling
(GraphiQL, codegen, IDE plugins) ships a fixed, deep introspection document
— depth ~15 — whose shape is bounded by the schema itself, not by the
caller. The guard targets runaway DATA selections.
